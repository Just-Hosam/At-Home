### Frontend setup

<br>

1. Install all dependencies.
```
npm install
```
2. Download the sass compiler extension (Live Sass Compiler has around 1.2 million downloads)

3. Config the sass compiler by following the these steps:
  - Go to VS code setting > live sass compiler config > Live Sass Compile â€º Settings: Formats
  - Change the savePath from `null` to `"frontend/public/styles"` (copy paste with quotations)
  - There is another setting just under called liveSassCompile.settings.generateMap, set it to `true`
  - Save changes

4. Run the server.
```
npm start
```
5. And finally, visit the following.
```
http://localhost:3030/
```

NOTE: App.scss is our main file, all additional scss files created must have an underscore _ at the start of them and then imported to App.scss. This will allow us to have only one file for css in public.
